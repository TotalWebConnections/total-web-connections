We are happy to announce a new set of questions has been release for our Here Be History Quiz! This new release sees the continent of Asia available as a quiz. In it, you’ll find questions covering everything from early civilization in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley up to European colonization.

This initial release sees around 300 new questions, but we’ll also be adding more over time so that count will only grow. Of course, this initial release will be missing details; there’s no way to cover the entire history of the continent in only 300 questions. But, over time we’ll be adding more questions, and covering some of the areas we missed. If your favorite bit of history is missing, don’t worry, we’re constantly adding new questions.

This new release also includes several new questions for our previous, European-based quizzes. Certain events like the Mongol invasions or the spread of Islam directly interact with many of the European powers at the time, so you’ll see those appear in other quizzes as well.

Lastly, we also released a new version of the mobile app that comes with a number of minor UI improvements. They are as follows:

- Percent correct display is now showing the proper value.
- Added separation between continents and lower level quizzes, Europe and France, for example.
- Adjusted pin sizing and location for some quizzes.
- Fixed an issue where adding extra spaces to a text question would cause it to be incorrect.
- Fixed an issue where zooming out would sometimes prevent zooming back in.
- Load after quiz ad display better for a more seamless experience.

That’s all for now. We have several more release items planned to end the year, so stay tuned for more exciting updates and quizzes!
