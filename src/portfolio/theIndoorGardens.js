  challenge: "SEO is a crtical piece to any good blog, and we wanted to make sure we followed all the best practices. One area we really wanted to nail was page speed. We recently re-built the entire site using Gastby, a static site generator, and have noticed a huge increase in page load speed. We're now hitting 90+ on almost every page using Google's core web vitals test, and have seen a good uptick in traffic because of it.",
  solution: "As noted, we used Gatsby to build this site. This makes it possible to serve each page as a static resource, which cuts down on time spend communicating with the server. In addition, we continue to work on thre site adding new features, as well as handling the marketing, SEO, and social media schedules.",
