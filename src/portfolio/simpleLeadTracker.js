  description: "Simple Lead Tracker is a custom CRM solution built for small businesses and freelancers. It focuses on being a simple and cost effective solution",
  challenge: "Our main goal was to streamline the CRM process and create a solution that was simple to use for small businesses. Existing solutions have a lot of bloat and can be cumbersome to use. We wanted to cut back all those extras, and provide an easy solution that could be setup and used right away. To that end, we really focused on creating an intuitive ui and focusing on only essential features.",
  solution: "The end solution achieves what we set out to do by providing a simple but effective application. It gives users the ability to manage their leads without being bogged down in too many extras. While it might not compete with more feature filled CMSs, it fills a niche between simple spreadsheets and advanced software.",
